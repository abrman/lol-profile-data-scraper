## From the author

This project was something I did to get a little familiar wih React and Machine learning in early-mid 2020. I no longer intend to update it.
The current published version should contain all champions and skins up until January 1st 2022.

## Updating the machine learning models

Whenever a new champion is released, running `model_training/generate_model.py` should do everything from downloading assets, augmenting the data & training the model. Ideally can be done in one go (can take a couple hours). It should update the model within the react app, so all you need to publish, is just `npm run build` and commit changes.

## What this tool does

This tool allows user to scrape data from their League of Legends profile via Screen Sharing API directly on a website without any data being shared and all computation done locally.

In simple terms the plan of this project is to guide the user to scroll the views such as _Loot_ and _Collection_ within the client while sharing the window with this website. This tool should capture relevant views and then use machine learning models to determine what champion/skin/shard/permanent etc. is in view and allow user to Export a table with all relevant information about their account.

# The ideal output of this tool:

1. A table of champions, their ownership, chest availability, mastery, and whether a shard is owned.
2. A table of all loot items, their value for disenchantment and crafting.
3. Screenshots of the relevant captured images.

# Tasks:

```
**Capture views:**
ðŸŸ¢ Loot
ðŸŸ¢ Collection - Champions
ðŸŸ¢ Collection - Skins
ðŸŸ¢ Emotes
ðŸŸ¢ Icons
âš« Wards
âš« Chromas

**Download assets to train model for views:**
ðŸŸ  Loot ("little_legends", "emotes" & "icons" are skipped)
ðŸŸ¢ Collection - Champions
ðŸŸ¢ Collection - Skins
âš« Emotes
âš« Icons
âš« Wards
âš« Chromas

**Train a classification model for views:**
ðŸŸ  Loot ("little_legends", "emotes" & "icons" are skipped)
ðŸŸ¢ Collection - Champions
ðŸŸ¢ Collection - Skins
âš« Emotes
âš« Icons
ðŸŸ¡ Wards (Loot ward model might work maybe)
âš« Chromas

**Present usable data:**
ðŸŸ¢ Create front end UI
âš« Currencies spent on owned items
âš« Ideal champions to craft to maximize champions owned
âš« Blue essence & Orange essence if everything was disenchanted
âš« Counts of everything owned (Example: 103/155 Champions owned, 32/1200 skins owned, etc.)
âš« Blue essence & Orange essence if everything was disenchanted

	Tables: (with tick-box "Show unowned" where hidden if no ownership or available shards permanents available)
    âš« Champions table:
    | Champion name | Owned | Champion Mastery | Chest available | Shards owned | Permanents owned | Eternal Shards | Store BE price | Store RP price | Shard upgrade BE cost | Disenchat Shard gain | Disenchant Permanent gain
    âš« Skins table:
    | Skin name | Owned | Shards owned | Permanents owned | Store RP price | Shard upgrade OE cost | Disenchat Shard gain | Disenchant Permanent gain

    âš« Wards table:
    âš« Icons table:
    âš« Emotes table:


**Utility:**
ðŸŸ¢ Large screenshot support:
Implement support for skin & loot libraries that span in height over 32767px (canvas height limit in most modern browsers)
ðŸŸ¢ Interface manager improvements:
Explore faster ways to get current view. Like One draw call and asking for data of interesting pixels rather than doing a 1x1px draw calls multiple times.
âš« Allow each view to alert the user that "show unowned" is enabled
âš« Fetch lookup data caching (don't want to call fetch requests twice for same file)

**Extra:**
âš« ALL OUT KDA Seraphine has 3 forms
```
