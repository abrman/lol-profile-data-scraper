# League of Legends profile data scraper

This project is a WIP

This tool allows user to scrape data from their League of Legends profile via Screen Sharing API directly on a website without any data being shared and all computation done locally.

In simple terms the plan of this project is to guide the user to scroll the views such as _Loot_ and _Collection_ within the client while sharing the window with this website. This tool should capture relevant views and then use machine learning models to determine what champion/skin/shard/permanent etc. is in view and allow user to Export a table with all relevant information about their account.

# The ideal output of this tool:

1. A table of champions, their ownership, chest availability, mastery, and whether a shard is owned.
2. A table of all loot items, their value for disenchantment and crafting.
3. Screenshots of the relevant captured images.

# The problem this tool aims to solve
