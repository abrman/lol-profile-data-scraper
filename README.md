# League of Legends profile data scraper

This project is a WIP

This tool allows user to scrape data from their League of Legends profile via Screen Sharing API directly on a website without any data being shared and all computation done locally.

In simple terms the plan of this project is to guide the user to scroll the views such as _Loot_ and _Collection_ within the client while sharing the window with this website. This tool should capture relevant views and then use machine learning models to determine what champion/skin/shard/permanent etc. is in view and allow user to Export a table with all relevant information about their account.

# The ideal output of this tool:

1. A table of champions, their ownership, chest availability, mastery, and whether a shard is owned.
2. A table of all loot items, their value for disenchantment and crafting.
3. Screenshots of the relevant captured images.

# Tasks:

```
**Capture views:**
ðŸŸ¢ Loot
ðŸŸ¢ Collection - Champions
ðŸŸ¢ Collection - Skins
ðŸŸ¢ Emotes
ðŸŸ¢ Icons
âš« Wards
âš« Chromas

**Download assets to train model for views:**
ðŸŸ  Loot ("little_legends", "emotes" & "icons" are skipped)
ðŸŸ¢ Collection - Champions
ðŸŸ¢ Collection - Skins
âš« Emotes
âš« Icons
âš« Wards
âš« Chromas

**Train a classification model for views:**
ðŸŸ  Loot ("little_legends", "emotes" & "icons" are skipped)
ðŸŸ¢ Collection - Champions
ðŸŸ¢ Collection - Skins
âš« Emotes
âš« Icons
ðŸŸ¡ Wards (Loot ward model might work maybe)
âš« Chromas

**Present usable data:**
âš« Currencies spent on owned items
âš« Ideal champions to craft to maximize champions owned
âš« Blue essence & Orange essence if everything was disenchanted
âš« Counts of everything owned (Example: 103/155 Champions owned, 32/1200 skins owned, etc.)
âš« Blue essence & Orange essence if everything was disenchanted

	Tables: (with tick-box "Show unowned" where hidden if no ownership or available shards permanents available)
    âš« Champions table:
    | Champion name | Owned | Champion Mastery | Chest available | Shards owned | Permanents owned | Eternal Shards | Store BE price | Store RP price | Shard upgrade BE cost | Disenchat Shard gain | Disenchant Permanent gain
    âš« Skins table:
    | Skin name | Owned | Shards owned | Permanents owned | Store RP price | Shard upgrade OE cost | Disenchat Shard gain | Disenchant Permanent gain

    âš« Wards table:
    âš« Icons table:
    âš« Emotes table:


**Utility:**
ðŸŸ¢ Large screenshot support:
Implement support for skin & loot libraries that span in height over 32767px (canvas height limit in most modern browsers)

âš« Interface manager improvements:
Explore faster ways to get current view. Like One draw call and asking for data of interesting pixels rather than doing a 1x1px draw calls multiple times.

**Extra:**
âš« ALL OUT KDA Seraphine has 3 forms
